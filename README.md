Don't stub your toe!
==================

This mod makes you autojump while sprinting, even when autojumping is disabled in the options.  
The functionality can be enabled and disabled in the mod options menu at any time while playing the game. It is client-side only and won't do anything when installed on a server.  
Be careful not to stub your toe.
